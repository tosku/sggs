###Findings and conclusions

####Bipartite matching
1. Matching dual graphs __cannot__ be bipartite.  
  The proof is that one cannot match all edges of the same side without matching all edges of the opposite side.

####Cycle basis
1. You can find lower energy for a cycle basis different than that constituted by the plaquettes but it is not a GS. So a GS is ensured by minimum periphery cycle basis possibly deriving from a minimum spanning tree (NP-hard).

###Matching on toroidal lattice
__Hint:__ For $L \times L$ fundcycle.nb produces $L^2+1$ cycles

1. Maybe a Moebius cycle with the plaquettes is the fundamendal cycle
basis
2. If so if every ground state is correct for a corresponding
realization in which the moebius cycle has different parity by flipping the edges cutting the moebius band.
